upper extremity. Which of the following responses by the kidneys is most likely?

A 57-year-old man receives radiation therapy for a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Despite therapy, the tumor progressively increases in size, and he dies 6 months later. His
tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene (TP53), leading to an inactive gene product. Based on this finding, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is
most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in which of the following phases of the cell cycle?

unable to speak, and no medical history is currently available. Physical examination shows a protuberant abdomen with a fluid wave and shifting dullness. There are no signs of
trauma to the area. Laboratory studies show no abnormalities. A CT scan of the abdomen is shown. Fluid is present in which of the following areas as indicated by the arrow?

A 59-year-old woman comes to the physician because of yellow skin for 5 days. Physical examination shows jaundice. There is mild epigastric tenderness on deep palpation. Serum
studies show:

These cells most likely originated from which of the following components of the pancreas?

A full-term female newborn is examined shortly after birth. She appears to be small for gestational age, and she has excess skin on the nape of the neck and lymphedema of the hands
and feet. Chromosomal analysis shows some cells with a normal 46,XY karyotype and some cells with a 45,X karyotype. Which of the following mechanisms best explains this cytogenetic
abnormality?

A 49-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She has a strong family history of coronary artery disease. Her blood pressure has ranged from 150/95 mm Hg
to 130/85 mm Hg during the previous three visits within the past 2 months. Her blood pressure today is 140/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no other abnormalities. Laboratory
studies show:

a drainage ditch. Examination of the left foot shows a purulent abrasion with edema, erythema, and tenderness on the lateral side. Infection is most likely to next spread from the
lateral side of the foot to the regional lymph nodes in which of the following areas?

A 6-day-old breast-fed boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother because of poor weight gain and irritability since delivery, and a 2-hour history of vomiting.
Physical examination shows jaundice and hepatomegaly. A reducing substance test result of the urine is positive, and a glucose oxidase test result is negative. The concentration
